# Face Recognition App

This is a full-stack web app where users can sign in/register and use the form to submit any image. If the image contains a face, the app will detect the face, using the Clarifai API Face Detection Model, and draw a box surrounding the detected face. The app keeps track of the number of entries the user submits and outputs that number on top of the page, just above the image submission form. 

The back-end code of the project is on a separate GitHub repo called face-recognition-api

What I Used for Front-End:
1. React.js
2. CSS (Tachyons)
